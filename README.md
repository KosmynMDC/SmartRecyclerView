Android SmartRecyclerView
==========================

### 1. Empty View for RecyclerView
Displays a special view called the empty view, when the recycler view adapter is empty. 
The empty view is used to provide feedback to the user that no data is available.
The empty view can be positioned anywhere in scren.
It need to be only attached to the smart recycler view and it's done.
It has the same behavior with [ListView.setEmptyView()](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterView.html#setEmptyView%28android.view.View%29).


Methods:
- `setEmptyView`: sets the view to show if the adapter is empty.
- `getEmptyView`: returns the empty view  that is used to provide feedback to the user that no data is available

Usage:

  ```java
  SmartRecyclerView recyclerView = (SmartRecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recycler_view);
  LinearLayoutManager layouManager = new LinearLayoutManager(this);
  recyclerView.setLayoutManager(layouManager);
  
  // empty view defined in layout
  recyclerView.setEmptyView(findViewById(R.id.empty_view));
  
  // empty view defined in code
  TextView view = new TextView(context);
  view.setText("No items available");
  recyclerView.setEmptyView(view);
  ```
